# Factorial Calculator
# Problem: Computer the factorial f a number using  While loop.
number = 5
i= 1
while number > 0:
    factorial = factorial* number
    number = number-1
print(factorial)

# Second method by using while loop >>>>>>>>>
# number = 5
# factorial= 1
# i =1
# while i<=number:
#     factorial = factorial* i
#     i+=1

# print(factorial)
